## Project development

### FrontEnd

In order to simplify the development of new page for the website we decided to use de micro framework CSS PicoCSS. 

* [Website](https://picocss.com)
* [Documentation](https://picocss.com/docs/)

### Backend

#### Route 

All route are initialized in python package ***assobot.core.package.route***, and each functionnal domain has it own file (plugin, guild, etc..)

#### File Structure

The project is composed of 2 project :

- Assobot (Discord Bot and WebServer)
- Assobot-sdk (CLI and plugin tools)
- Assobot-plugin (Source code of default plugins)

#### Assobot

The Assobot project contains many folders and files :
- core (source code of the project)
- plugins (install folder of all assobot plugin)
- static/default (resources files of default website)
- static/plugins (resources files of plugins)
- templates/default (HTML file of default website)
- templates/plugins (HTML file of plugins)

> For ***static*** and ***templates*** each plugin has it's own folder.

#### Assobot-sdk

The SDK project contains many folders and files :
- plugin/plugin_template (template used to initialise new plugin)
- plugin/plugin_default (folder which contains source code of default plugin like '**WelcomePlugin**')

## Plugin development

In order to create your first assobot plugin you can use the assobot-sdk. This SDK contains various scripts that handle creation, package, etc for Assobot plugin.

### Create a plugin

In order to create your plugin you should use the command below.

```bash
poetry run assobot_sdk --create-plugin ./
```

Then, you just have to follow instructions in your terminal. 

Finally, you will get a new folder which contains your plugin. The folder structure of the plugin is very easy. 

```
- root : <plugin_name>
    - core   : main python package of your plugin
    - static : folder which contains static resources used by the the web interface
    - templates : the web interface main page
    - __init__.py : file used to initialise python package
    - plugin.py : file used to connect Assobot to your plugin
```

If you want add features you can code into the **core** folder and call it from the file **plugin.py**

### Build your plugin

When your plugin is ready, you can build it thanks to the command below.

```
poetry run assobot_sdk --build-plugin <path_to_your_plugin_folder>
```
Then you will find a **dist** folder with inside a file which looks like something like : **<plugin_name>-0.0.0.zip**. 

Finally you can install this plugin web interface of the AssoBot.
